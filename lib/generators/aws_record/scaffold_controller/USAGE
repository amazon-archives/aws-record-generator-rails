Description:
    Stubs out a scaffolded controller, its seven RESTful actions and related
    views. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or under_scored. The
    controller name is retrieved as a pluralized version of the model name.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers and invokes helper,
    template engine framework generators.

Example:
    `rails generate scaffold_controller CreditCard...`

    Credit card controller with URLs like /credit_cards.
        Controller: app/controllers/credit_cards_controller.rb
        Views:      app/views/credit_cards/index.html.erb [...]
        Helper:     app/helpers/credit_cards_helper.rb
