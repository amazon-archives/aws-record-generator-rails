Description:
    Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and
    views, along with a full test suite. The resource is ready to use as a
    starting point for your RESTful, resource-oriented application.

    Pass the name of the model (preferably in singular form), and an optional list of attributes

    Attributes are declarations of the fields that you wish to store within a model. You can pass
    a type and list of options for each attribtue in the form: `name:type:options` if you do not provide
    a type, it is assumed that the attribute is of type `string_attr`

    Each model should have an hkey, if one is not present a `uuid:hkey` will be created for you.

    Timestamps are not added by default but you can add them using the `--timestamps` flag
    More information can be found at: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-record-generator/blob/master/README.md 

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

    For example, 'scaffold post title:hkey body published:boolean' gives
    you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
    an index that lists them all, as well as a resources :posts declaration
    in config/routes.rb.

    If you want to remove all the generated files, run
    'rails destroy scaffold ModelName'.

Examples:
    `rails generate scaffold post title:hkey body published:boolean`
    `rails generate scaffold purchase amount:float:hkey tracking_id:integer:rkey`
